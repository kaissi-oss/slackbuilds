The goal of the mozplugger project is to provide a minimalist, clean,
 and stable general purpose Mozilla plugin module that allows the
user to embed and launch their favorite application to handle the 
various different types of media found on the Internet.

Notes:

* For Firefox, you may need to delete your local
  $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/xxx/pluginreg.dat
  file for mozplugger to be enabled correctly after you install/update it.
  Replace xxx with the name of your profile.

* For Opera and Acrobat Reader, go to
  Opera > Settings > Preferences > Advanced > Downloads
  and do a "Quick find" for "pdf", "Edit" each result to change the
  "Use plug-in" to "MozPlugger 2.1.5 ..." and save your changes.
