# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-local-lib:
perl-local-lib: This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a
perl-local-lib: user-local Perl module library located within the user's home
perl-local-lib: directory. More generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping
perl-local-lib: and usage of a directory containing Perl modules outside of
perl-local-lib: Perl's @INC.
